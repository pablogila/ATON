    '''
    Finds the line(s) containing the `key` string in the given `filepath`,
    returning a list with the matches.\n
    The value `matches` specifies the max number of matches to be returned.
    Defaults to 0 to return all possible matches. Set it to 1 to return only one match,
    or to negative integers to start the search from the end of the file upwards.\n
    The value `additional` specifies the number of additional lines
    below the target line that are also returned;
    2 to return the found line plus two additional lines below, etc.
    Negative values return the specified number of lines before the target line.
    The original ordering from the file is preserved.
    Defaults to `additional=0`, only returning the target line.
    By default, the additional lines are returned in the same list item as the match separated by a `\\n`,
    unless `split=True`, in which case these additional lines
    are splitted and added as additional items in the list.
    This way, `split=False` allows to differentiate between matches.\n
    To use regular expressions in the search, set `regex=True`.
    By default regex search is deactivated, using the faster mmap.find and rfind methods instead.
